Based on the analysis of the provided document, this is an **Industrial Report on the Forging of 4340 Steel Samples**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of its contents:

### **1. Purpose and Scope**

The document is a technical report from **ABC Forging Ltd.**, prepared by its R&D Division in November 2025. The primary goal of the study was to:
*   Analyze the deformation characteristics of 4340 steel during forging.
*   Assess how variations in chemical composition and sample geometry affect the material's response to strain.
*   Generate baseline data to optimize future forging processes and heat treatments.

The document has been reviewed and stamped as "Tested Ok" by an Assistant Professor from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Palakkad.

### **2. Material and Process**

*   **Material:** The study focuses on **4340 steel**, a high-strength nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy known for its toughness and fatigue resistance. It is commonly used in high-stress applications in the aerospace and automotive industries.
*   **Process:** The report details controlled hot forging trials. Billets of steel were preheated to between 1150°C and 1200°C and then compressed using a **1000-ton hydraulic press**.

### **3. Key Findings and Observations**

The report concludes that 4340 steel has excellent forgeability and that all samples deformed uniformly without cracking. The key highlights are:

*   **Effect of Composition:** Minor variations in Nickel (Ni) and Chromium (Cr) content significantly affected the material's flow behavior and strength at elevated temperatures.
*   **Performance of Different Heats:**
    *   **Heat A61146** showed the highest total strain (0.47) and the most significant work hardening, indicating high resistance to deformation.
    *   **Heat A32880** displayed the lowest strain (0.18) and minimal deformation resistance.
*   **Conclusion:** The study successfully established the forging characteristics for different heats of 4340 steel, providing valuable data for industrial applications. Future work will involve microstructural analysis to link the material's structure to its properties post-forging.

### **4. Data and Tables**

The report contains specific data to support its findings:
